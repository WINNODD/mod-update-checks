    "changelog": "- 47 can no longer return briefcases by dropping them, as he always drops them when blending. Attempting to retrieve a dropped briefcase after blending would crash the game.\n- The only way to return briefcases is now through manual interaction with the carousel.\n- The briefcase 47 brings to a mission (if required) will always be the last one he held in the safehouse.",
